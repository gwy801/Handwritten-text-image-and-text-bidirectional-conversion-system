The author's husband retired from a middle school many years ago. One day he got a former schoolgirl's letter from America, which expressed her thanks for helping her study math well. What the schoolgirl did obviously shows that the author's husband's devotion has great influence on her which reminds me of my math teacher Mr. Song. During my senior high school days, I did not often get good marks for math, but Mr. Song never scolded me. Instead, he always asked me to raise questions whenever I needed help. In particular, he was very patient though sometimes I had no way to solve some difficult math problems. Every time my mother was worried about my studies, he would smile and say. " Your boy is a good student with great potential. So long as he keeps on hard- working, he is certain to get success in the future. " And under his considerate help, I successfully got high marks for the national college entrance examination. I love Mr. Song for great personality, and I strongly believe that what # how to us students can affect our wonderful future greatly.
